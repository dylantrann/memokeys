# Piano Game

I've always strugged with reading sheet music, even after playing on and off for over 4 years. That being said, I think a simple game to help me just get used to seeing the notes and the keys they represent would help a lot. I've always wanted to have an app to do exactly that, but since I couldn't find a decent one, heck might as well make it myself. 

## General Concept
1. There will be an image (maybe built in would look better than image) of a piano note on a key.
2. There will be a selection of 7 buttons on the bottom, one for each unique note letter.
3. The user will then be able to click one of the buttons.
4. If it is correct, it will light green for a second then move on. If it is wrong, it will light red for a second then get greyed and cross out.
5. Once finished, a new key will appear and repeat

## Additions
For now, I'm thinking it should go inifite and just be a practice game. But definitely a lot of ideas for future implements.
- Add a timer and scoreboard
  - Can either be set amount of seconds to get as far as possible or limited wrong guesses 
- Add sharps, flats, chords...
- Add note sounds whenever they appear
- Add keyboard functionality
  - Can choose notes by typing their respective key
  - Can use arrow keys / tab to select buttons
- Make a continuous flowing version
  - An entire "sheet music" would appear, where the user can go note by note pressing the correct note
  - If scoreboarded, timer for how long to complete or how little mistakes/far ventured in timed situation 
- Make the buttons and actual keyboard
  - Actually this one might not be too hard, can just make overlapping buttons
