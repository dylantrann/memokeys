# Memokeys
I've always strugged with reading sheet music, even after playing on and off for over 4 years. That being said, I think a simple game to help me just get used to seeing the notes and the keys they represent would help a lot. I've always wanted to have an app to do exactly that, but since I couldn't find a decent one, heck might as well make it myself. 

## Concept
1. A single note will appear.
2. Press the piano key that matches the note. 
3. If incorrect, the button will light up red and become disabled. If correct, the button will go green and the game will reset.

### Future Additions/Updates
For now, I'm thinking it should go inifite and just be a practice game. But definitely a lot of ideas for future implements.
- Add a info button and logo
- Update the note sound effects (right now using only free ones I could find but they're kinda bad)
- Add some sort of point system (or multiple)
  - Timer and scoreboard: can either be set amount of seconds to get as far as possible or limited wrong guesses
  - Lives (and maybe timer): limited incorrect guesses, try to get as far as possible
  - Daily/Longest/Total streak: keeps score of daily plays, longest streak, and/or total accuracy (correct/incorrect ratio) in local storage 
- Add sharps, flats, chords...
  - Not just sharps on individual notes, I want entire major and minor keys to be represented either at random or selected
- Add additional keyboard functionality
  - Can choose notes by typing their respective key
  - Can use arrow keys / tab to select buttons
  - Freeplay with open keyboard
- Make a continuous flowing version
  - An entire "sheet music" would appear, where the user can go note by note pressing the correct note
  - If scoreboarded, timer for how long to complete or how little mistakes/far ventured in timed situation
